# MD4: Simplified and Generalized Masked Diffusion for Discrete Data


## Installation

### Create Python environment

please use `requirements_gpu.txt` if your accelerator is GPUs, use
`requirements_tpu`.txt when using Google Cloud TPUs.

```
python -m venv md4_venv
source md4_venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements_[gpu/tpu].txt
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:~/path/to/md4"
```

## Usage

prepare openwebtext for training (i.e., tokenize and pack examples)

```
mkdir data_dir
python prepare_openwebtext_data.py
```

train a MD4-S model over text data (using openwebtext).

```
python md4/main.py --config=md4/configs/md4/openwebtext.py --sharded=false --workdir=./expt
```

alternatively, you can train a MD4-S model over image data (using cifar10).

```
python md4/main.py --config=md4/configs/md4/cifar10.py --sharded=false --workdir=./expt
```

### choose batch size

Batch size depends on your compute resource. For training a MD4-S model with
sequence length 1024, eight `A100` GPUs can support a maximum batch size of
`128`. If running on TPUs, eight `v5litepod` chips can support a maximum batch
size of `32`.
